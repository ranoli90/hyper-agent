# .editorconfig — HyperAgent Chrome Extension
# =============================================================================
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS:
#   Chrome MV3 extensions REQUIRE all content scripts, the manifest, and all
#   HTML pages to be UTF-8 encoded. On Windows, many editors default to
#   UTF-16 LE ("Unicode" in Windows-speak), which causes:
#
#       "Could not load file 'content-scripts/content.js' for content script.
#        It isn't UTF-8 encoded."
#
#   This file tells every EditorConfig-aware editor (VS Code, JetBrains,
#   Sublime Text, etc.) to ALWAYS save files as UTF-8 with LF line endings.
#
# FOR LLMs / FUTURE DEVELOPERS:
#   - Do NOT change charset to utf-8-bom; Chrome rejects BOM in JS files.
#   - Do NOT change end_of_line to crlf; use lf everywhere.
#   - If you see the "not UTF-8 encoded" error, run: npm run fix:sources
#     then rebuild: npm run build
#
